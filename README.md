This project is for COMP429 but I am going to modify it and make a fully functional application.

To Run this application:

1. clone it
2. in root directory of the project run $(npm i)
3. build the project $(npm run build)
4. run $(npm run start <port number to start on>

Soon I will add unit tests
More comments
And will also add optional React front end
